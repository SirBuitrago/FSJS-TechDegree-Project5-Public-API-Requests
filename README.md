# TechDegree-Project5-Public-API-Requests
 Project 5 of the Full Stack JavaScript Tech Degree.


For individualizing the project: I decided to add a colorRandomizer() to add a unique color background to the modal window of each profile card as you iterate through them. I also added a snippet of code to randomize the color of the physical background of the site itself. But it was dangerously looking like a crazy disco party and decided to just leave the randomizer for the modal window itself, for a clean toggling between profiles.

# TechDegree-Project5-Public-API-Requests
 Project 5 of the Full Stack JavaScript Tech Degree.
 
This Project consists of building a site that pulls random profile information from an API using JSON and generates that information in the form of a public profile page with individual profile cards that you can iterate through. You can also keyword search for a specific profile. I used Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, CSS for majority of the project.


For individualizing the project: I decided to put in a colorRandomizer() that adds a unique color background to the modal window of each profile card as you iterate through them. I also added a snippet of code to randomize the color of the physical background of the site itself. But it was dangerously looking like too much for the eyes and decided to just leave the randomizer for the modal window itself, for a clean toggling between profiles.

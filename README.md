# TechDegree-Project5-Public-API-Requests
 Project 5 of the Full Stack JavaScript Tech Degree.


For individualizing the project: I decided to add a colorRandomizer() to add a unique color background to the modal window of each profile card as you iterate through them. I also added a snippet of code to randomize the color of the physical background of the site itself. But it was dangerously looking like too much for the eyes and decided to just leave the randomizer for the modal window itself, for a clean toggling between profiles.
